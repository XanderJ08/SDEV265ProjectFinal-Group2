# SDEV265ProjectFinal-Group2
Final Project for SDEV265 - Systems/Software Analysis and Projects

There are two options for running this program. First, it may work virtually, using Replit’s hosting by going to https://replit.com/@ThomasWarenski/SDEV-200-Team-2-Project. You can create an account with Replit and then select Fork and run. The fork and run option will create a separate instance of all files associated with the program, which you can inspect and modify as necessary to your convenience and run right in the editor.

If you do not want to use Replit, you can instead use an interpreter. This route is more difficult if you don’t have an interpreter installed, but it is easy to do so. First, if you do not have an interpreter installed, you will need to follow the instructions at https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download for your respective system or find the official interpreter on your device’s app store by searching python. The program went through testing using Python 3.10, so it is advisable to install that version. Next, you need to install the program and the dependent libraries. Install the program from the GitHub or Replit page as a .zip; extract the files into a separate folder, then open the main with your Python interpreter.

To install the libraries depended upon, you can use the interpreter itself. You must enter “pip install PIL” to download the libraries. After that, the program will handle everything from there; you just have to run it.
